                <h1>Hi, loveyyy!</h1>
                <p>
                    It's been a year na since the day you've told me na we're together na.<br>
                    Time flies so fast talaga huhuhu. Sobrang happy ko talaga during that <br>
                    day, hanggang ngayon. Like after all of those heartbreaks & friend <br>
                    zones, finally someone accepted me wholeheartedly. Even though I've <br>
                    made a mistake before that hurt you, tinanggap mo pa rin ako. <br>
                    Thank you for the chance that you've given me, baby. I'm very blessed<br>
                    and lucky to have you, to be loved by you. I know meron pa rin akong<br>
                    pagkukulang in different times and situations, but rest assured na<br>
                    I won't leave you in every situation that we'll face. Sa 'yo lang ako,<br>
                    palagi. You're not alone in your journey in life, my baby. I'm here,<br>
                    supporting you, proud of you in all ways, always.
                </p>
