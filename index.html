                <h1>Hi, loveyyy!</h1>
                <p>
                    It's been a year na since the day you've told me na we're together na.
                    Time flies so fast talaga huhuhu. Sobrang happy ko talaga during that 
                    day, hanggang ngayon. Like after all of those heartbreaks & friend 
                    zones, finally someone accepted me wholeheartedly. Even though I've 
                    made a mistake before that hurt you, tinanggap mo pa rin ako. 
                    Thank you for the chance that you've given me, baby. I'm very blessed
                    and lucky to have you, to be loved by you. I know meron pa rin akong
                    pagkukulang in different times and situations, but rest assured na
                    I won't leave you in every situation that we'll face. Sa 'yo lang ako,
                    palagi. You're not alone in your journey in life, my baby. I'm here,
                    supporting you, proud of you in all ways, always.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know inaantay mo talaga na sabihin ko ilibre kita sa watsons pero
                    huhuhu I can't afford it, baby •︵• I know you'll understand naman,
                    binibiro mo lang me hayyy. Pero if ever, h'wag ikaw tampo ahh •︵•
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's all na po, baby. I love you very much, for lifetime na 'to ha?
                    wala na iwanan hmmp. Happy Anniversary again, see you next week (･ε･)
                </p>    
                <p>Only yours,</p>
